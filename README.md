Since the release of Manus, some closed-source platforms have faced problems such as high cost, limited access, and difficulty in privatization deployment, although they have excellent user experience and commercial support. Although open source frameworks have higher flexibility and transparency, they are slightly lacking in terms of functional integrity, style richness, and stability.

**Co-Sight** Committed to striking the best balance between cost, quality, stability and ease of use. It supports low-cost large models to generate high-quality and beautiful reports comparable to Claude models, and can be flexibly deployed in private environments, helping enterprises and individuals quickly build their own Manus-like systems.

## 📡 NetHeal-Agent Competition Scenario

This branch adds **NetHeal-Agent**, a multi-agent diagnosis and self-healing system for a campus 5G private network. It reuses the Co-Sight planner, concurrent DAG scheduler and Actor tools while adding five specialist roles, ten telecom-operations tools, three reproducible fault scenarios, a durable incident control plane, and a professional operations cockpit.

The primary demo covers: alarms → four-way parallel evidence collection → root-cause ranking → risk-graded remediation → work order/dry-run commands → KPI recovery verification → Markdown/HTML closure report.

The operations layer adds an incident state machine, SQLite WAL persistence, role-based diagnosis/approval/execution, immutable lifecycle events, audit records, topology impact highlighting, KPI before/after views, and low-confidence human-review routing.

After starting Co-Sight, open `http://localhost:7788/cosight/netheal.html` for the NetHeal cockpit or use the original `http://localhost:7788/cosight/` page to inspect the live Planner/DAG/tool trace.
